# MachineLearning
This is my implementations of Machine Learning algorithms in Java.

## DecisionTree
(AKA [Homework #1](http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vgogate/ml/2018s/homeworks.html))
Current state:
- [x] Implement Building Tree
- [x] Implement Information Gain heuristic function
- [x] Implement Testing Tree / Calculating Accuracy
- [x] Implement Printing Tree
- [ ] Implement Pruning Tree
- [ ] Implement other heuristic functions

Output (at current state):
```
Dataset 1:
Information Gain Heuristic:
Pre-pruning accuracy: 75.85%

Dataset 2:
Information Gain Heuristic:
Pre-pruning accuracy: 72.33%
```
