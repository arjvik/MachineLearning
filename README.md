# MachineLearning
This is my implementations of Machine Learning algorithms in Java. Some of these are from UTD course homework, others from watching an online course.

These implementations can all be used as a library, or run using their runner programs.

## Currently implemented algorithms (more to come):
- [Decision Tree][1]
- [Gradient Descent (Linear Regression)][2]
- [Logistic Regression][3]
- [K-Nearest-Neighbor][4]
- [Ham/Spam Email classifier (multiple algorithms)][5]
    - [Naive Bayes][6]
